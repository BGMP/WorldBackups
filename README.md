# WorldBackups
A simple Windows script designed to help you backup Minecraft worlds

## Usage

Download, set the script variables to match your environment and finally double-click. If Windows automatically gets raid of the file, just copy the content of [copy.bat](https://github.com/BGMP/WorldBackups/blob/master/copy.bat) into a new .bat file on your end.

### Variables:

* [`world_name`](https://github.com/BGMP/WorldBackups/blob/10cb71e1030d549c5745b3cd58fb33d8f3456e40/copy.bat#L8) Backups reference name (No need for it to be the exact same name as your world's).
* [`world_directory`](https://github.com/BGMP/WorldBackups/blob/10cb71e1030d549c5745b3cd58fb33d8f3456e40/copy.bat#L9) The world you want to backup.
* [`world_backup_directory`](https://github.com/BGMP/WorldBackups/blob/10cb71e1030d549c5745b3cd58fb33d8f3456e40/copy.bat#L10) The directory you want your backups to be stored at.

## Reasoning behind

Laziness overall, [@vYuri](https://github.com/vYuri) wanted it lol
